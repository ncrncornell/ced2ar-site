      <abstract>The SIPP Synthetic Beta (SSB) is a Census Bureau product that integrates person-level micro-data from a household 
				survey with administrative tax and benefit data. These data link respondents from the Survey of Income and Program Participation 
				(SIPP) to Social Security Administration (SSA)/Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form W-2 records and SSA records of retirement and 
				disability benefit receipt, and were produced by Census Bureau staff economists and statisticians in collaboration with 
				researchers at Cornell University, the SSA and the IRS. The purpose of the SSB is to provide access to linked data that 
				are usually not publicly available due to confidentiality concerns. To overcome these concerns, Census has synthesized, 
				or modeled, all the variables in a way that changes the record of each individual in a manner designed to preserve the 
				underlying covariate relationships between the variables. 
				The only variables that were not altered by the synthesis process and still contain their original values are gender and a 
				link to the first reported marital partner in the survey. Seven SIPP panels (1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 2001, 2004) 
				form the basis for the SSB, with a large subset of variables available across all the panels selected for inclusion and 
				harmonization across the years. Administrative data were added and some editing was done to correct for logical 
				inconsistencies in the IRS/SSA earnings and benefits data.</abstract>

      <dataProcessing>
        <p>Creation of the SSB:</p>
        <p>The SSB is created from several data sources. The survey data are drawn from
				multiple panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP):
				the 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, and 2004 panels. The administrative data
				are drawn from the following SSA files: the Master Earnings File, the Master
				Beneficiary Records (MBR), the Supplemental Security Records (SSR), the 831
				Disability File (F831), and the Payment History Update System (PHUS).</p>
        <p>The creation of the SSB begins with the construction of the Gold Standard
				File (GSF). To construct the GSF, a set of variables from the 1990-2004 SIPP
				panels are standardized to produce consistent measures across panels. The
				SIPP respondent identifiers are mapped to Social Security Numbers (SSB) using
				the Census Bureau's erson Information Validation System (PVS). Using the
				list of SSN's for the sample is SIPP respondents, SSA creates Summary
				Earnings Records (SER) and Detailed Earnings Record (DER) extracts from the
				Master Earnings File. SSA also creates extracts from the four benefit files
				(MBR, SSR, F831, and PHUS) from the corresponding master files. Using the
				mapping between the SIPP identifiers and SSN's, Census then links these
				extracts to the SIPP data. The GSF consists of person-level research
				variables created from these linked data.</p>
        <p>The next step in the creation of the SSB is to impute missing values in the
				GSF multiple times. This process results in four files (implicates) referred
				to as the Completed Data implicates. Each of these implicates contains
				original GSF values where non-missing and imputed values where the original
				value is missing. The imputations across Completed Data implicates are
				independent of each other.</p>
        <p>The Completed Data implicates from the basis of the data synthesis that
				produces the SSB files. From each Completed Data file, four synthetic
				datasets are created by synthesizing variables conditional on the values in
				the Completed Data file. Thus, the SSB consists of sixteen files (implicates).
				All but the following data are synthesized in the SSB implicates: gender,
				OASDI benefit type, and spouse link (specific variables described in the
				data items section below). Detailed documentation of the process of data
				synthesis is available in the publication "<ExtLink URI="http://www2.vrdc.cornell.edu/news/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/ssafinal.pdf">Final Report to the Social
				Security Administration on the SIPP/SSA/IRS Public Use File Project</ExtLink>" at<ExtLink URI="http://www2.vrdc.cornell.edu/news/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/ssafinal.pdf">http://www2.vrdc.cornell.edu/news/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/ssafinal.pdf</ExtLink>.</p>
        <p>The Completed Data and SSB implicates need not all have the same number of
				records. In order to be included in a Completed Data or SSB implicate, an
				individual's (possibly imputed or synthesized) age must be at least fifteen
				years as of January 1 in the first year of his or her SIPP panel. The
				interaction between this restriction and the variation in imputed and
				synthesized ages across implicates causes the exclusion of a slightly different set of individuals from each Completed Data and SSB implicate.</p>

          <emph>This analysis was first performed using the SIPP Synthetic Beta (SSB) on the Synthetic Data Server housed at Cornell University which is funded by NSF Grant #SES-1042181. These data are public use and may be accessed by researchers outside secure Census facilities. For more information, visit http://www.census.gov/sipp/synth_data.html. Final results for this paper were obtained from a validation analysis conducted by Census Bureau staff using the SIPP Completed Gold Standard Files and the programs written by this author and originally run on the SSB. The validation analysis does not imply endorsement by the Census Bureau of any methods, results, opinions, or views presented in this paper.</emph>

        <disclaimer>The data synthesis process employed by Census to protect the linked data from the risk of disclosing the identity of individuals 
			is relatively new and substantially changes both the survey and administrative data. The intent of the modeling done as part of the synthesis 
			is to preserve relationships among variables that are of interest to researchers while ensuring that personally identifiable information is 
			not revealed to the data user. It has not been feasible to ensure accuracy by comparing every relationship among SSB variables with the 
			corresponding relationship in the underlying confidential micro-data. Hence, we strongly urge researchers not to publish results produced 
			from the SSB without first requesting that Census validate these results with confidential data housed in a secure environment at the 
			Census Bureau. Census will perform this validation free of charge to researchers, as resources permit and according to the protocol 
			established by the three agencies involved and outlined below. Without validation of results, Census, SSA, and IRS make no guarantee 
			of the validity of the SSB for any research purpose.

        <p>Using SSB:</p>
        <p>The GSF and Completed Data implicates contain personally identifiable
				information protected by Titles 13, 26, and 42 and cannot be accessed without
				Census Bureau Special Sworn Status nor outside of Census Bureau facilities.
				The SSB files, however, have been cleared by the Census Bureau Disclosure
				Review Board, SSA, and IRS for use by individuals without Census Bureau Special
				Sworn Status and outside of Census Bureau facilities.</p>
        <p>Researchers interested in using the SSB can submit an application to the Census
				Bureau. The application form and instructions can be downloaded from<ExtLink URI="http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/methodology/sipp-synthetic-beta-data-product.html">http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/methodology/sipp-synthetic-beta-data-product.html</ExtLink>.
				Applications will be judged solely on
				feasability of the proposed project (i.e., that the necessary variables are

				be given an account on a server where the data can be accessed and analyzed.
				While no SSB data downloads are permitted at this time, users do not have to
				operate behind the Census Bureau firewall to access this server.</p>
        <p>The SSB is designed to be analytically valid in that sense that point
				estimates should be unbiased and estimated variances should lead to inferences
				similar to those that would be drawn from an identical analysis on the Completed
				Data implicates. Initial tests of analytic validity of the SSB have been
				promising. All SSB users are invited to help further test the analytic validity
				of the SSB by submitting programs used to analyze the SSB to be run on the
				Completed Data and/or Gold Standard files. Users need only inform Census Bureau
				staff of the location on the server of such programs and work with Census Bureau
				staff to ensure that the programs run without error. Census Bureau staff will
				run the programs on the confidential data and release to the user resulting
				output that are cleared for release by the Census Bureau Disclosure Review
				Board. In order to evaluate the effects of the data synthesis separate from the
				effect of imputing missing data, comparisons should be made between results from
				the SSB and the Completed Data. To evaluate the effects of missing data
				imputation, comparisons should be made between results from the Completed Data
				and the Gold Standard.</p>

      <relMat>When analyzing the SSB, users should account for the multiple imputation aspect

      <relMat label="Validation">
        <p>Protocol for Validation of Results:</p>
        <p>Census will validate results obtained from the SSB on the internal, confidential version of these data (Completed Gold Standard Files). Users who wish to obtain validated results should follow the protocol outlined here.
				The restricted access site will provide SAS and Stata analysis software and a computing environment similar to the one used to analyze the confidential Completed Gold Standard data on Census Bureau internal computers. Researchers should follow the Census Bureau programming requirements described in SSB Validation Request Guidelines to ensure that the programs will successfully transfer to internal Census computers for validation. Researchers should plan to share their results and programs from the synthetic data analysis with Census, ORES/SSA and SOI/IRS.
				After programs have successfully run without error on the synthetic data, researchers may request that Census run these programs on the Completed Gold Standard Files. Only programs successfully run without error on the SDS will be eligible to be run on the confidential data by Census staff. Any programs that produce errors on the Completed Gold Standard Files will be returned to users for correction.
				Once an analysis has been repeated on the Completed Gold Standard File, the results will be reviewed by Census staff for disclosure concerns. Researchers should familiarize themselves with standard Census disclosure rules for outside projects (See the<ExtLink URI="http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/programs-surveys/sipp/methodology/Researcher_Handbook_20091119.pdf">RDC Researcher Handbook</ExtLink>here) and should fill out the appropriate memo documenting the requested output (see<ExtLink URI="http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/programs-surveys/sipp/methodology/RDCDisclosureRequestMemo.pdf">RDC Disclosure Request Memo</ExtLink>). Data products and output approved by Census staff will be released to the users, ORES/SSA, and SOI/IRS.
				The validation process can be accomplished in as little as one week for simple results that are generated by clean code and have no disclosure issues. However if the code does not run properly, the sample sizes are too small, or the researcher does not accurately fill out the disclosure memo, the process can take much longer. Census makes no guarantee on the length of time between submission of programs and the release of results from the confidential data.
				For more information about the validation process, including advice on how to make the process go smoothly and quickly, please see<ExtLink URI="http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/programs-surveys/sipp/methodology/SSB%20Request%20Guidelines_May2013.pdf">SSB Validation Request Guidelines</ExtLink>.</p>

      <labl>Marital History Variables</labl>
      <txt>Marital history is presented as two arrays of 8 elements describing up to 4 marriages. This history retains at most 4 dates of origin and the associated 4 dates of dissolution (whether due to divorce or death), if applicable, along with the corresponding type of event (marriage, divorce, or widowhood) for each SIPP respondent. The wave 2 Marital History topical module provides the majority of this information for up to 3 marriages.  If an individual had more than 3 marriages, no dates for those marriages between the second and most recent are collected during the topical module interview.
				
For individuals who participate in the topical module, we supplement this information by searching for new marriages or the termination of an existing marriage utilizing our knowledge of monthly marital status covering the period of the panel beyond wave 2. We rely exclusively on the complete set of monthly marital status indicators for people who do not participate in the topical module.  

The two marital history arrays, one comprised of dates and the other of event types, are edited to ensure internal consistency for linked spouses.  Missing event dates or reasons are acquired from the spouse who has provided this information during a SIPP interview.  This means that in the case of a deceased individual, the surviving spouse's report of widowhood is transferred to their former spouse.  Likewise, for respondents who leave the household due to divorce (and are no longer interviewed by the SIPP), the spouse remaining in the household supplies the details regarding marital dissolution for both.  

It is possible for beginning or ending date information to not identically match for the linked spouses.  In this case, we evaluate whether topical module details were supplied.  If both spouses participated in the topical module, the data are considered as likely to be reliable from either individual.  We examine whether the first spouse's beginning date occurs before the previous marriage end date for either spouse while the second spouse's beginning date occurs after the previous marriage end date of both spouses.  If so, then the second spouse's beginning date replaces the first spouse's beginning date.  Alternatively, if the reverse is true, then the first spouse's beginning date replaces the second spouse's beginning date.  When no obvious conflicts with the date of the start of the current marriage and the date of termination of the previous marriages of either spouse exist, then a random number is used to determine which spouse's information to retain.  A similar algorithm is implemented to resolve issues relating to non-matching ending dates of the linked spouses (in this case, each spouse's subsequent marital start date is taken into consideration).  

When disagreements between the beginning or ending dates occur and only one of the two spouses participated in the topical module, the participating spouse's information is considered to be more reliable (provided that the adoption of the date presents no conflicts with previous or subsequent marital events for either spouse).  In the absence of topical module participation for both spouses, a random number is used to determine which spouse's information to retain.  Any persisting conflicts between dates of marital events are remedied by utilizing a random number to determine the most reasonable event date for the pair.  As a final step, the cleaned file is carefully reviewed once more to ensure internal consistency.</txt>

Differences may exist between the disability variables on the MBR and the F831 due to differing lengths of the time series, as well as to the fact that research version of the MBR used to create the Gold Standard recorded a maximum of two events (e.g., events occurring between the initial and most recent entitlement may be censored).</txt>

      <txt>The Master Benefits Records (MBR) is SSA's main file to track who is receiving Old Age Survivor and Disability (OASDI) benefits, the reason for receipt, and the monthly benefit amounts payable to the individual.  
				
The Payment History Update System (PHUS) contains actual payments delivered to OASDI beneficiaries.  The data from the PHUS may differ from what are contained on the MBR due to discrepancies between the timing of SSA awarded amounts and the actual payments made to participants.  This situation would be expected to affect disability cases more than aged cases because it takes more time to establish eligibility to receive disability.

Individuals are eligible to receive benefits due to their own earnings history and age, as well as due to a spouse's earnings history and age.  In this section retirement and disability are "own" benefits while aged spouse, widowed spouse, and other are "spouse" benefits.  The age requirements for receiving each type of benefit are as follows:

Retire - minimum age 62 (reduced benefit), full retirement age (full benefit)
Disability - under age 65 or full retirement age, whichever is greater;  at full retirement age, these benefits convert to retirement.
Aged Spouse - minimum age 62(reduced benefit), full retirement age (full benefit), spouse must be retired or disabled
Widowed Spouse - minimum age 60(reduced benefit), full retirement age (full benefit), spouse must be deceased
Other - no age requirements

Until the year 2000, the full retirement age was 65.  From 2000 to 2022, the full retirement age is increasing by 2 months each year so that by 2022 the full retirement age will be 67.

The benefits reported in this section are total benefits received at a point in time.  The MBR research extract provided by SSA to create the Gold Standard contains information about different reasons for receiving benefits but does not always allow the amount due to each reason to be accurately separated from the total.  Hence we have elected to report total benefits at a point in time and researchers should be careful to note that when an individual is receiving both own retirement and aged spouse benefits, the amounts listed for each benefit type will be redundant, i.e. there is really only one total amount and two reasons for receiving it.

SSA calculates benefits based on an individual's lifetime earnings history following rules which they publish in "Annual Statistical Supplement to the Social Security Bulletin," available for each tax year on the Social Security website, www.ssa.gov.</txt>

The variables from these files that are included in the SSB are described below.  
				
Not  all SIPP respondents have linkages to SSA/IRS administrative data, including:  those who refused to provide their SSN; those whose SSNs were not validated; and those with valid SSNs who never worked, and never applied for benefits or received benefits.  In the Gold Standard, individuals without a validated SSN or without SSA/IRS administrative records had missing data for all SSA/IRS-derived variables described below.  Among these people, those respondents without a validated SSN had all administrative data imputed as part of the data completion  process.  Hence in the completed Gold Standard and the synthetic data, only individuals with no work or benefit history have zero earnings and missing benefits.</txt>

      <txt>Personid of linked spouse.  Across the Gold Standard and Completed Data files, spouse_personid uniquely identifies spouses of SIPP respondents.  In the SSB, spouse_personid uniquely identifies records within a particular implicate.   In order to strengthen confidentiality protection, spouse_personid in the SSB does not link records across implicates or to the Gold Standard and Completed Data files.

Linked spouse is defined as the first person to whom the SIPP respondent was married during the time period covered by the SIPP panel.  Individuals could enter the panel already married and then each would be linked to the other.  Individuals could also get married during the course of the panel.  If this was the first observed marriage for each member of the couple, they were linked together.  Individuals could also get divorced during the course of the panel and then remarry.  In many cases, this later marriage caused a new individual to join the panel.  This new SIPP respondent would only be linked to his or her spouse if the spouse (and original SIPP sample member) had not already been observed married to someone else.  If the original SIPP sample member had been previously linked by marriage to another SIPP sample member, this original link was maintained in spouse_personid.  However the marital history reflects the ending of this marriage and the occurrence of the next marriage for the original SIPP sample member.  Likewise, the new SIPP sample member who joins through marriage will have that marriage date recorded in his or her marital history but will have a blank spouse_personid.  

In summary, this variable captures only one marriage partner and does not provide a history of marriage partners even if this history is (partially) observed in the SIPP.    

The link between SIPP respondents and their spouses has not been perturbed in any way in the SSB.  The same individuals will be linked as married partners in the Gold Standard, the Completed Data, and the SSB.</txt>

      <txt>In the 1990-2004 Census-internal SIPP panels, a value for sex is included on each wave file.  Thus, there are actually as many sex variables as there are waves of the survey and some changes occur across waves as a result of data collection error.  Sex is selected from the array of variables sex1-sex{max number of waves} in which the wave corresponds either to the month in which marital status is first observed (for those without spouses during the course of the SIPP) or to the month in which the respondent's spouse is assigned instead of from a fixed point in the survey.  Thus when a spouse is never assigned, an individual's gender comes from the first wave where they report being not married.  For individuals who are assigned a spouse, gender comes from the first wave where they reveal their spouse.  Finally, an indicator variable for males was created from the categorical sex variable for analytic convenience.

This variable is unsynthesized on the SSB and is never missing so there are no imputed values in the Completed Data.</txt>

      <txt>This variable was taken from a hierarchy of SSA sources instead of the respondent-provided value in the SIPP.  Date of birth was selected from the first non-missing value in the following files:  (i) SSA's Master Benefits Record (MBR) file, (ii) the Census Bureau's Person Characteristic File (PCF) whose main input is the SSA Numident file, and (iii) SSA's Supplemental Security Record (SSR) file.  Thus, this variable is administrative and sometimes differs from the birth date reported in the SIPP survey itself.  When missing due to the lack of a validated SSN for the SIPP respondent, date of birth was imputed using date of birth from the Census-internal version of the SIPP.  

We chose the administrative source for two reasons.  First, the administrative birth date was more often consistent with the other administrative data (benefits and earnings).  For example, when age was calculated using the administrative birth date, there were fewer individuals who appeared to retire before age 62.  Second, the differences between the administrative birth date and the birth date reported in the survey helped to increase the difficulty of re-identifying a record in the original SIPP public use data from a record in the synthetic data, thus improving the confidentiality protections.  This variable is coded as a SAS date variable.  This format gives the number of days between the date of birth and January 1, 1960.  An individual born on January 1, 1959 would have birthdate=-365 and an individual born on January 1, 1961 would have birthdate=365.</txt>

      <txt>Health limits kind or amount of work
For the 1996-2004 panels, information on work-limiting disability comes from core question (edisabl) during wave 2 for people ages 15-69, when respondents were asked whether health limited the type or amount of work.  This indicator is supplemented with details from the Functional Limitations and Disability topical module (wave 5 for 1996-2004 panels, variable ejobdif) that covers people ages 16-67.  For the 1990-1993 panels, disability information comes from the core question (disab) during wave 2 for people ages 15-69, when respondents were asked whether health limited the type or amount of work.  This information is supplemented with details from the Functional Limitations and Disability topical module (waves 3, 3, 6, 3 for 1990-1993 panels, variables TM8914, TM8918, and TM8920) that covers people ages 16-67.  In order to make the sum_disab consistent for all panels, both responses were taken from the core and topical modules, when available, with any positive indication of health limiting the kind or amount of work flagging the positive response.

      <txt>Health prevents work 
For the 1996-2004 panels, information on work-preventing disability comes from core question edisprev during wave 2 for people ages 15-69, when respondents were asked whether health prevented work.  This indicator is supplemented with details from the Functional Limitations and Disability topical module (wave 5 for 1996-2004 panels, variable ejobcant) that covers people ages 16-67.  For the 1990-1993 panels, the core questionnaire does not ask respondents whether health prevents work.  This information is solely obtained from the Functional Limitations and Disability topical module (waves 3, 3, 6, 3 for 1990-1993 panels, variables TM8922 and TM8924) that covers people ages 16-67.  When available, the core and topical modules were used in conjunction to construct summary measures of disability, with any positive indication of health preventing work flagging the positive response.
