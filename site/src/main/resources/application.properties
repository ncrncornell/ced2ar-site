# Most configuration options in this file should not need to be
# changed for standard installations. However, you will need to set
# options in a similar file (also in this directory) named
# application-default.properties
# Note that this file is not and should not be distributed with
# application code as it contains configuration-specific information,
# including database credentials. Following are several options
# that should be set.
#
#  # Server config #
#
# server.* properties apply to the embedded tomcat only. If you deploy to
# an external tomcat using WAR packaging you have to configure those
# values in the external tomcat itself.
#
# The port of the web application should default to 8080;
# You can change this if desired. contextPath is the top-level
# prefix containing this application on your application server;
# If no other applications are running, setting to / is fine.
# Note that application server deployments can override the
# contextPath.
